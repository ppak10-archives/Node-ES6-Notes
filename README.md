###### Notes on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) Todo List [Example](https://redux.js.org/basics/exampletodolist) built with [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Getting Started
Node uses experimental modules to use ES6 syntax with ```.mjs``` extensions. To start cd into the following ```Node-ES6``` directory and type in the command:
```
npm start
```
This should run the ```node --experimental-modules server.mjs``` command to start a new server on localhost, port 3000
