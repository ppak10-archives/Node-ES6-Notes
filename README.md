# Node-ES6
###### Notes on using ES6 syntax without packages in Node

## Getting Started
Node uses experimental modules to use ES6 syntax with ```.mjs``` extensions. To start cd into the following ```Node-ES6``` directory and type in the command:
```
npm start
```
This should run the ```node --experimental-modules server.mjs``` command to start a new server on localhost, port 3000
